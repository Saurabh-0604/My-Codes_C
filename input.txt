Nuclear tests
From 1992 to 1999 Kalam was scientific adviser to India’s defense minister, and he later served as
principal scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government, with the rank of cabinet minister. 
During this period he played a key role in the government’s weaponization of missile systems, 
giving India nuclear capabilities. In 1998 he was one of the chief coordinators of the Pokhran-II 
series of nuclear tests, in which five bombs were detonated at a test range in the town of Pokhran, 
Rajasthan state. His prominent role in the country’s nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a 
nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in 
the international community. In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 
2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed society to a 
developed one in 20 years. Among other measures, the plan called for increasing agricultural 
productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and for widening access to 
health care and education.
